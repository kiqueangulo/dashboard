### Description

Welcome to DASHBOARD! This a frontend browser application the users will be able to manage expenses and revenues, keep track of employees, customers, and product orders of their business, and display data in several types of charts for different analysis.

I wanted to improve my React skills that I learned in bootcamp, and this application fitted that goal in different aspects of development. This project was possible thanks to Adrian Hajdin a.k.a.
JavaScript Mastery ([Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery), [GitHub](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)), whose videos have helped me throughout the programming learning curve.
