## This is a broswer dashboard for charts analysis, product orders and sales organization, and team workflow. All in one.

### Description

Welcome to DASHBOARD! This a frontend browser application the users will be able to manage expenses and revenues, keep track of employees, customers, and product orders of their business, and display data in several types of charts for different analysis.

I wanted to improve my React skills that I learned in bootcamp, and this project fitted that goal in different aspects of development.
